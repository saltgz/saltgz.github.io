The aim of the laboratory is to explain the learning process of a machine,
through a series of simple  and intuitive teaching activities.

The reference technique for Machine Learning that will be presented to the class
is the Artificial Neural Network. This technique has distinguished itself in
recent years, both in research and in industry,  for its wide use in the
classification of images, text and sounds.
