categories: research
---

We present a language-based approach tackling the problem of IoT integration
at the [Microservices Conference 2019](https://www.conf-micro.services/).
The approach is based on the use of the microservice-oriented programming
language Jolie, that we extended to support IoT protocols such as coap and mqtt.
