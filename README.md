Personal academic website repository, 
made with Jekyll static web page generator and minima theme.

## TODO

- Add to projects page last projects (why anybody does do that!);
- Specify contributions for each publication in `publications` posts;
- Publication should take advantage of `Scholar` gem in order 
to produce automatic bibliography from a *LateX* `biblio.bib` file.
