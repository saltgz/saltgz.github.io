#### Short Bio

[BSc in Computer Science](https://webapps.unitn.it/Biblioteca/en/Web/Tesi) and [MSc in Bioinformatics](http://www.biocomp.unibo.it/lsbioinfo/), I am a PhD Candidate at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cs.unibo.it), University of Bologna. 
Member of the [Focus Research Team at INRIA (Sophia-Antipolis)](http://focus.cs.unibo.it) and the [SPACES research group](http://www.cs.unibo.it/projects/spaces).

Currently, I am involved in a Post-Doctoral position at the University of Bologna.
The project aims to take advantage of _Machine Intelligence_ techniques and _Edge Computing_ to accomplish proper virtualization and to achieve optimal _workload mobility_ of software components in **Industrial Internet of Things** (IIoT) settings.

In 2019, I completed my PhD, supervised by [Professor Maurizio Gabbrielli](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~gabbri/) and [Professor Ivan Lanese](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~lanese).
The research focused on the exploitation of **Microservices-Oriented Computing** in the development of interoperable application for **Internet of Things** systems. 
The European institution [EIT Digital](https://www.eitdigital.eu/) and the Italian company [Engineering SpA](https://www.eng.it) financially supported my grant.

In 2018, the Head of the [Concurrency and Logic research group](https://concurrency.sdu.dk) of the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Institutter_centre/Imada_matematik_og_datalogi) at the [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk/en/), [Professor Fabrizio Montesi](https://www.fabriziomontesi.com), invited me in a research project concerning the usage of programming language abstractions to manage data handling in _Edge Computing_ scenarios.

In addition to academic research activities, I am also interested in teaching-learning practices.
In this regard, [I carried out several courses and workshops in Schools, Universities and Companies](education/).
Moreover, I am intrigued by the theory of Computer Science Education and [Computational Thinking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3105726.3106194).
