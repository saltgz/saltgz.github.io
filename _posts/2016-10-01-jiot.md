### [J<span class="text-primary">IoT</span>](http://www.cs.unibo.it/projects/jolie/jiot.html) -- A programming language for IoT
---
The Internet of Things (IoT) promotes the communication among heterogeneous entities, from small sensors to Cloud systems. 
However, IoT systems tend to grow as homogeneous isolated platforms - usually referred as "IoT islands", which hardly interact.

To achieve a higher degree of interoperability among disparate IoT platforms, the [J<span class="text-primary">IoT</span>](http://www.cs.unibo.it/projects/jolie/jiot.html) project investigates how abstractions suitable for service-oriented and microservice architectures can aid integrating disparate IoT islands. 
[Jolie](https://www.jolie-lang.org) currently supports the main technologies from Service-Oriented Computing, such as TCP/IP, Bluetooth, and RMI at transport level, and HTTP and SOAP at application level. 

The integration of IoT-specific protocols into the service-oriented setting of [Jolie](https://www.jolie-lang.org) poses some interesting challenges, the two main being 
- the integration of unreliable channels (UDP/CoAP) and 
- bridging the simple request-response communication style of [Jolie](https://www.jolie-lang.org) with the peculiarities of the Publish/Subscribe communication pattern.
