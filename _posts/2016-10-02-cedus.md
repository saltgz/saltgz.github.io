Within the EIT Digital Program 2017 [CEDUS](https://www.eitdigital.eu/newsroom/news/article/eit-digital-unleashes-the-power-of-data-for-better-city-living/), the “City Enabler For Digital Urban Services”, will provide a software product relying on FIWARE platform, called City Enabler (CE), for crawling, collecting and rendering on a map valuable data at urban scale as well as rapidly developing urban services. 
The University of Bologna, under the PhD program in Engineering and Computer Science, having an active role in the research field of Big Data Analysis and Smart Cities Innovation is providing scientific support to the project. 
On one hand the aim is to investigate possible integration of existing technologies in the world of micro-services and on the other hand the goal is to supply urban service providers with valuable data by collecting and analysing different aggregation methods in order to able to meet needs of the three major players involved in metropolitan areas life: citizens, companies and city administration.
