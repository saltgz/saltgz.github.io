title: Ephemeral data handling with microservicesc
categories: research
---

We present a framework in the Jolie programming language for ephemeral data
handling in microservices at the [Microservices Conference
2019](https://www.conf-micro.services/). Microservices are the building blocks
of software for modern Large-scale systems that, due to regulations (GDPR) and
other constraints (e.g., IoT and Edge Computing) need to handle data in an
ephemeral way. Our framework includes a query language and an execution engine,
that we formalised instantiating a sound version of the MongoDB query language.
In our presentation we will illustrate the features of our framework through a
non-trivial eHealth use case, which describes the handling of the data and the
workflow of a diagnostic algorithm.
