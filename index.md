[BSc in Computer Science](https://www.disi.unitn.it) and [MSc in
Bioinformatics](http://www.biocomp.unibo.it/lsbioinfo/), I am a PhD student at
the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cs.unibo.it),
University of Bologna. Member of the [Focus Research Team at INRIA (Sophia
Antipolis)](http://focus.cs.unibo.it) and the [SPACES research
group](http://www.cs.unibo.it/projects/spaces).

My PhD is supervised by [Professor Maurizio
Gabbrielli](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~gabbri/) and [Professor Ivan
Lanese](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~lanese). Our research interest focuses on
_Programming Languages_ for _Distributed Systems_, and their impact on the
development of applications in Smart City scenarios. The European institution
[EIT Digital](https://www.eitdigital.eu/) and the Italian company [Engineering
SpA](https://www.eng.it) financially support my grant.

In 2018, the Head of the [Concurrency and Logic research
group](https://concurrency.sdu.dk) of the [Department of Mathematics and
Computer
Science](https://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Institutter_centre/Imada_matematik_og_datalogi)
at the [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk/en/), [Professor
Fabrizio Montesi](https://www.fabriziomontesi.com), invited me in a research
project focusing on Programming Language Abstractions for Cloud and Embedded
Systems.

In addition to academic research activities, I am interested in
teaching-learning practices. More precisely, I am intrigued by the theory of
Computer Science learning, the concept of Education-as-a-Service (EaaS) and the
Didactical Engineering (DE), that is, the study of techniques for teaching
activities design and experimentation . In this regard I carry out courses and 
workshops in Schools, Universities and Companies, mostly concerning the [basic concepts
of Artificial
Intelligence](({{ site.baseurl }}/dissemination/artificial-intelligence-laboratory.html) and [Machine Learning]({{ site.baseurl }}/education/tutorial-ml.html).
