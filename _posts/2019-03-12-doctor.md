categories: research
---

The tool permits to have an estimation of a student risk to quit the University
course during his/her first year. The valuation of the studentâ€™s situation is
based on personal data of the student (like age and gender) and his/her academic
history (High School type, High School geographical region, High school score,
University course, University school and course type). This kind of data are
available before the application moment and for this reason this tool can be
used to suggest courses in which the student will likely have success or to let
the student know that he/she could need some extra study support aiming to
decrease the drop-out occurrences.

The tool is available *open source* under the  [GNU General Public License
