### Data Ephemerality with Microservices

In this post we present a new framework, written for the [Jolie programming language](jolie-lang.org), developed to deal with ephemeral data handling in Microservices.

The framework, called [TQuery](github.com/jolie/tquery), was presented at the [Microservices Conference](https://www.conf-micro.services/), held in Dortmund on March of 2019.
Software for modern Large-scale systems, due to regulations (GDPR) and power-constraints (e.g., IoT and Edge Computing) need to handle data in an ephemeral way. 

[TQuery](github.com/jolie/tquery) includes a query language and an execution engine, that we formalised instantiating a sound version of the **MongoDB Aggregation Framework**.

<!-- In our presentation we illustrate the features of our framework through a non-trivial **eHealth** use case, which describes the handling of the data and the workflow of a diagnostic algorithm. -->
