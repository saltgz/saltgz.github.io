# Honor Code (from Standford)

We strongly encourage students to form study groups.
Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups.
However, each student must write down the solutions independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session.
In other words, each student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by him/herself.
In addition, each student should write on the problem the set of people with whom s/he collaborated.
Further, since we occasionally reuse problem questions from previous years, we expect students not to copy, refer to, or look at the solutions in preparing their answers.
It is an honor code violation to intentionally refer to a previous year's solutions.
This applies both to the official solutions and to solutions that you or someone else may have written up in a previous year.
